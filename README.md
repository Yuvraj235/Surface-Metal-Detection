# Surface-Metal-Detection


One of the most significant building materials of the modern era is steel, and the manufacture of flat
sheet steel is a labor-intensive task which requires time and cost. It's important to identify and categorize
the surface flaws or defects on these metal sheets, since they must go through a comprehensive
inspection process before shipping or delivering steel in order to prevent flaws. Then, we can use the
categorical data to use the sheets in different ways according to their features and quality. In this study,
we use the YOLOv5 algorithm to identify the six different types of visual flaws or defects (rolled-in
scale, patches, crazing, pitted surface , inclusion and scratches) on the surface of metal sheets before
processing, enabling the production of high-quality goods.
